// Scenario/briefing narration is generated live per selected target (the text

// browser (kokoro-js — no Python/pip required) rather than pre-baked audio
// files. Generation runs in narrationWorker.js on a separate thread — Kokoro's
// generate() call is real WASM computation, and running it on the main
// thread was blocking UI responsiveness (button presses lagging) while it
// worked. This file just sends { text, voice } to the worker and gets a
// { blob } back; the worker owns loading/caching the model itself.
// NOTE: American ('af_'/'am_') voices are the most reliably supported path in
// kokoro-js today. British ('bf_'/'bm_') voices can throw "Invalid language
// identifier" errors on some kokoro-js/model builds — if you want a British
